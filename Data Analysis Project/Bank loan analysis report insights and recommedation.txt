o	   The total amount funded for these good loans is $371 million, which is approximately 85% of the overall funded amount.

•	Financial Summary:
o	The bank received $436 million from good loans, indicating a significant proportion of the total   received amount.

•	         Interest Rate Impact:
o	     With an average interest rate of 12%, good loans contribute substantially to the bank's interest income. This rate likely reflects the bank's pricing strategy for risk management and profitability.

 Conclusions:

The bank's loan system demonstrates a high rate of good loans (86.2%), which contributes positively to the overall funding and recovery amounts. The substantial amount of $371 million funded and $436 million received from good loans indicates robust performance in this segment.

The presence of bad loans (13.8%) presents a challenge, with a lower recovery amount of $37 million compared to the $66 million funded. This suggests potential areas for improvement in risk assessment and collection processes.

The average interest rate of 12% is consistent across both good and bad loans. While this rate is standard, the financial impact varies significantly between loan categories, underscoring the importance of effective risk management.

Recommendations:

1. Enhanced Risk Assessment:
   - Implement more rigorous criteria and predictive analytics to reduce the proportion of bad loans and improve the overall quality of the loan portfolio.

2. Improved Collection Strategies:
   - Develop more effective strategies for recovering amounts from bad loans to reduce the gap between funded and received amounts.

3. Review Interest Rate Strategy:
   - Assess the interest rate strategy to ensure it aligns with the risk profile of the loans and maximizes profitability without adversely affecting the loan approval rates.

By addressing these areas, the bank can further enhance its loan system's efficiency and financial performance.
